# Basic Instructions for Mini Assignments

In your browser, go to your GitHub repository - `https://github.com/WSU-kduncan/ceg2350-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME`

Click into the folder titled `minis`

Click the `Add File` button, then select "Create new file"

Name the file. In the edit file box, **paste** the contents of the mini assignment.

Every mini assignment will be different. The first assignment, for example, will ask that you fill in the definitions of commands. Others will have you think on common (or uncommon) situations that come up in systems adminstration and ask you to think.

When you are ready to save your work (or take a break), scroll to the bottom to view the dialog regarding `commit`ting your work. For the moment, think of `commit`s as save points. For each save point, you will write a message about what changed.

- Notice there are two textboxes in the commit field - skinny and paragraph sized. The skinny box is where you'll place a quick description - this one is required to create a `commit`. The paragraph sized box is where you can add bigger details about changes.
- The radio button defaults to select `Commit directly to the main branch.` - leave this as is.
- Select the green `Commit` button when you are ready to save your work.

To continue editing your file:

- Click on the file
- Click on the "Edit this file" pencil icon towards the right
- When you are done editing, repeat the steps above to commit your work.

## Submission

  - URL should look like: https://github.com/WSU-kduncan/ceg2350-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/blob/main/minis/assignment.md
