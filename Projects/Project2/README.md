# Project 2 - NOT FINALIZED

File Sharing (is Caring)

## Assignment Notes

For this project you need access to your AWS console. [Return to here and click "Start Lab"](https://awsacademy.instructure.com/courses/13269/modules/items/1137325). **Once the icon next to "AWS" is green, click "AWS" to open the console.**

In your GitHub Classrooms repo, in the `Linux` folder, create a new folder named `Project2`. The deliverables for this project will be documenation and screenshots, so you are welcome to work in your repo wherever you are comfortable. I would float towards VSCode myself.

## Part 1 - create a `samba` share

You ahve it set up, but how do you connect?

For this part, choose at **minimum** two operating systems and try connecting to your `samba` share. In your documentation section, detail how to connect.

Note: WSL2 Ubuntu does count as one OS - Windows would count as a second.

## Part 4 - documentation

In your `Project2` folder, create a `README.md` file with the following documentation.
